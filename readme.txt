PORTABLE MODE FOR OPENMSX WINDOWS
=================================
 
 
This little tool converts openMSX (including Catapult) in a portable emulator with full persistence.
 
It includes two executables (x86 & x64 editions are included)
 
 openmsx-portable         (Runs a full openmsx installation with catapult frontend)
 openmsx-only-portable    (Runs only main openmsx does not touch any Catapult registry entries)
