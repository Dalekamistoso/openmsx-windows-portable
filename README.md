Portable Mode for openMSX Windows (1.0)
=======================================
 
 
This tiny tool converts openMSX (including Catapult) in a portable emulator 
with full persistence enabled.

 
It includes two executables (x86 & x64 editions are included):
 
openmsx-portable      (Runs a full openmsx installation with catapult frontend)

openmsx-only-portable (Runs only main openmsx no Catapult)


Warning:
========

Use the executable according to your platform!!

In other words, use x86 launcher for x86 same goes for x64 platform!!

If you use by example the x86 launcher in your x64 Windows the folders will be 
not correctly redirected.
